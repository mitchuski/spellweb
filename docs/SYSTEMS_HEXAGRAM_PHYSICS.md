# AgentPrivacy & Spellweb: Systems Physics

## The Geometry of Sovereignty

This document maps the hexagram-based physics underlying the agentprivacy dual-agent architecture and spellweb forge system.

---

## I. THE 64-VERTEX LATTICE

### Binary State Space

The foundation is a 6-dimensional binary space yielding **64 vertices** (2^6).

Each vertex represents a unique sovereignty configuration—a **blade address** in the lattice.

```
Dimension Encoding:
  d1 (bit 0) → Protection    → 🛡️ Key Custody
  d2 (bit 1) → Delegation    → 🤝 Credential Disclosure
  d3 (bit 2) → Memory        → 📜 Agent Delegation
  d4 (bit 3) → Connection    → 🔗 Data Residency
  d5 (bit 4) → Computation   → ⚡ Interaction Mode
  d6 (bit 5) → Value         → 💎 Trust Boundary

Blade ID = d1 + d2×2 + d3×4 + d4×8 + d5×16 + d6×32
Range: 0 (all yin) → 63 (all yang)
```

### Pascal's Triangle Distribution (7 Strata)

The 64 vertices arrange into **7 layers** by Hamming weight (yang count):

```
Layer 0:  C(6,0) =  1 vertex   — Null (no sovereignty)
Layer 1:  C(6,1) =  6 vertices — Single-edge
Layer 2:  C(6,2) = 15 vertices — Twin-edge
Layer 3:  C(6,3) = 20 vertices — Triple-edge (trust triad)
Layer 4:  C(6,4) = 15 vertices — Quad-edge
Layer 5:  C(6,5) =  6 vertices — Penta-edge (near-sovereign)
Layer 6:  C(6,6) =  1 vertex   — Dragon (full sovereignty)
                   ──────────
                   64 total
```

This is row 6 of Pascal's Triangle: **1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1**

---

## II. HEXAGRAM MAPPING (I CHING)

### 64 Hexagrams = 64 Blades

Each blade address maps to a classical I Ching hexagram (King Wen ordering):

```
Binary Order → King Wen Number → Hexagram Name
000000 (0)   → ䷁ (2)          → The Receptive (Kun)
111111 (63)  → ䷀ (1)          → The Creative (Qian)
```

### Line Reading (Bottom → Top)

```
Line 6 (top)    → d6 Value         → Trust Boundary
Line 5          → d5 Computation   → Interaction Mode
Line 4          → d4 Connection    → Data Residency
Line 3          → d3 Memory        → Agent Delegation
Line 2          → d2 Delegation    → Credential Disclosure
Line 1 (bottom) → d1 Protection    → Key Custody
```

**Yang (━━━)** = dimension active, sovereignty claimed
**Yin (━ ━)** = dimension dormant, sovereignty unclaimed

---

## III. BLADE TIERS & CEREMONY STANCES

### Tier Classification by Stratum

```
LIGHT BLADE  (1-2 yang lines)  → 🗡️ Sky Blue   (#87ceeb)
HEAVY BLADE  (3-4 yang lines)  → ⚔️ Silver     (#c0c0c0)
DRAGON BLADE (5-6 yang lines)  → 🐉 Gold       (#ffd700)
```

### Ceremony Style → Dimension Activation

The hexagram is NOT "more = better". Different ceremony styles produce different stances:

```
QUICK STRIKE (<20 seconds):
  - Computation activates (⚡ decisive action)
  - Light blade, focused intent

MEDITATIVE (1+ minutes):
  - Memory activates (📜 time investment)
  - Value activates (💎 sustained presence)
  - Deeper stratum possible

SPELL-HEAVY (3+ spells cast):
  - Delegation activates (🤝 agency transferred)
  - Computation activates (⚡ spell intensity)

EXPANSIVE (4+ nodes traversed):
  - Connection activates (🔗 multi-party coordination)
  - Protection activates (🛡️ clear boundaries)

DEEP (3+ laps completed):
  - Delegation activates (🤝 iteration)
  - Memory activates (📜 accumulated state)
```

The blade reflects HOW you approached the ceremony, encoded as your hexagram stance.

## IV. DUAL-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### The Canonical Pair

```
SWORDSMAN (⚔️)                    MAGE (✦)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Color: #e74c3c (red)              Color: #9b59b6 (purple)
Role: Boundary-keeper             Role: Connection-weaver
Attention: Broad vigilance        Attention: Focused agency
Function: Master (protection)     Function: Emissary (projection)
Persona: Soulbis                  Persona: Soulbae
Side: Right                       Side: Left
Brain: Right hemisphere           Brain: Left hemisphere
Mode: Deliberate (hold→choose)    Mode: Reactive (tap→fire)

Orbit emojis: From equipped blade  Orbit emojis: From learned spells
```

### Control Scheme (Hemispheric Mapping)

The control scheme maps to brain hemisphere function:

```
RIGHT SIDE = SWORDSMAN (Master) = RIGHT CLICK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Right click hold   → View/choose stance (master deliberates)
  Right click release → Cast stance, leaves mark
  S key              → Full stance editor

  Character: Deliberate, holistic, spatial
  The master holds posture before acting.
  Stance = the shape you maintain.

LEFT SIDE = MAGE (Emissary) = LEFT CLICK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Left click tap     → Cast last selected spell (quick action)
  Left click hold    → View all spells in orbit
  M key              → Full spell editor

  Character: Reactive, sequential, action-oriented
  The emissary executes outward projection.
  Spell = energy cast into the world.
```

### Hemispheric Correspondence

```
RIGHT BRAIN ↔ SWORDSMAN ↔ RIGHT CLICK
  - Holistic perception
  - Spatial awareness
  - Pattern recognition
  - The stance/posture you hold
  - Boundaries and containment
  - "What shape am I?"

LEFT BRAIN ↔ MAGE ↔ LEFT CLICK
  - Sequential processing
  - Action execution
  - Language and symbols
  - Casting spells outward
  - Connection and projection
  - "What do I send?"
```

### Separation Principle (Acts 24-26)

Three axes that make dimension complete:

```
Agent Axis:     Swordsman ⊥ Mage
Data Axis:      Shielded ⊥ Public
Inference Axis: Generator ⊥ Solver
```

### Wandering Orbs Physics

```
ORBIT_RADIUS    = 35px     (separation between orbs)
ORBIT_SPEED     = 0.0008   (slow meditative rotation)
DRIFT_SPEED     = 0.002    (movement through graph)
TRACE_SPEED     = 0.008    (constellation tracing)

States:
  WANDER  → Orbs drift through graph, orbiting each other
  EVOKE   → Orbs return to ceremony panel
  TRACE   → Orbs follow constellation path, drawing cuts
```

## V. ARTIFACT SLOTS (21 WINDOWS)

### The Forge Inventory

```
MAGE SPELLS:     8 slots  (grimoire capacity)
FORGED BLADES:   7 slots  (self-forged artifacts)
WITNESSED BLADES: 6 slots  (bilateral promise artifacts)
                 ────────
TOTAL:          21 windows
```

**21** = Fibonacci number, triangular number (1+2+3+4+5+6)

### Slot Meanings

```
Mage's 8 Spells:
  - Learned from nodes with proverbs/emojiSpells
  - Each spell has: emoji + label + proverb
  - Orbit the mage's wandering orb
  - Included in blade.md exports

Swordsman's 7 Forged:
  - Self-generated from evoke ceremonies
  - Hexagram stance embedded in proof
  - Tier (light/heavy/dragon) by stratum
  - Constellation path inscribed

6 Witnessed:
  - Received via blade.md import
  - Promise Theory bilateral exchange
  - Neither can forge alone; both sign
  - Trust graph edges
```

## VI. FORGE PROGRESSION (LAYER UNLOCKS)

```
Forgings    Layer Unlocked    Distribution
─────────────────────────────────────────────
1           Layer 1           6 states (single-edge)
3           Layer 2           15 states (twin-edge)
10          Layer 3           20 states (triple-edge)
15          Layer 4           15 states (quad-edge)
30          Layer 5           6 states (penta-edge)
50          Layer 6           1 state (Dragon/full sovereignty)
```

The Dragon requires 50 forgings to unlock—mastery through repetition.

## VIII. PROMISE THEORY (WITNESS SYSTEM)

### Bilateral Promise Bundles

From Act 13 (Book of Promises) and VRC specification:

```
Structure:
  Alice's commitment + Bob's commitment + bilateral proverb + cost

Cost Signal: 0.01 ZEC each (ceremony, not transaction)

Phases:
  🧙‍♂️²🤝 → ⚡🎯 → 📜± → 🔮🔍 → 🛡️⚖️ → ✨🔗 → 🗣️📿 → 🌅🏗️
```

### Witness Blade Creation

```
1. Import blade.md from another person
2. Parse constellation path (their journey)
3. Enter witness mode (trace their path)
4. Complete your own evocation
5. Bilateral proof: your witness + their blade
6. Trust graph edge created
```

---

## IX. SPELLBOOK STRUCTURE

### Five Canonical Spellbooks

```
1. FIRST PERSON        28 acts   (narrative arc)
2. ZERO KNOWLEDGE      32 tales  (technical curriculum)
3. BLOCKCHAIN CANON    12 chapters (cypherpunk history)
4. PARALLEL SOCIETY    variable  (exit/sovereignty)
5. PLURALITY           variable  (coordination/governance)
```

### First Person Acts (28)

```

Act 27:     RESERVED (Swordsman's Forge)
Act 28:     Ceremony Engine
```

---

## X. TOROIDAL FIELD & LATTICE GEOMETRY

### The 64-Tetrahedra Lattice

The lattice is not flat—it wraps in a **toroidal field**:

```
- 64 vertices (hexagram states)
- Edges connect states differing by one bit (single line change)
- 6 dimensions fold into torus
- "Tempering in toroidal field" = navigating wrapped space
```

### Manifold Dragon (Act 23)

Three frameworks converge:

```
ALGEBRA   → Binary encoding, group theory
GEOMETRY  → Torus, lattice, holographic boundary
STORY     → Narrative navigation, constellation paths

"Where the Lattice Remembers Its Shape"
```

### Holographic Bound (Act 24)

```
"Where the Boundary Holds the Whole"

- Fragment holds the whole
- BRAID architecture (bounded reasoning graphs)
- Privacy = geometry of becoming
- The triangle cannot collapse
```

---

## XI. NUMERICAL CONSTANTS

### Foundational Numbers

```
2   → Binary (yin/yang)
6   → Dimensions, hexagram lines, orbit slots
7   → Layers (0-6), forged blade slots
8   → Mage spell slots
13  → Total artifacts (7+6)
21  → Total windows (8+7+6), Fibonacci
28  → First Person acts
32  → Zero Knowledge tales
64  → Vertices (2^6), hexagrams
```

### Derived Relationships

```
6 dimensions → 64 states (2^6)
6 lines → 7 layers (Pascal row 6)
7 forged + 6 witnessed = 13 blades
8 spells + 7 forged + 6 witnessed = 21 windows
28 acts + 32 tales = 60 lessons (near 64)
```

---

## XII. STATE TRANSITIONS

### Dimension Activation (Yang Emergence)

```
Protection:  nodeCount ≥ 2 OR lapCount ≥ 2
Delegation:  spellsCast ≥ 3 OR lapCount ≥ 3
Memory:      duration ≥ 60s OR (duration ≥ 30s AND laps ≥ 2)
Connection:  nodeCount ≥ 4 OR (nodes ≥ 3 AND laps ≥ 2)
Computation: duration < 20s OR spellsCast ≥ 3 OR nodeCount ≥ 1
Value:       chargeLevel ≥ FLAME OR (duration ≥ 60s AND spells ≥ 1)
```

### Blade Forging

```
Input:  Constellation + Ceremony Stats + Spells Cast
Process:
  1. Calculate dimension activation (6 booleans)
  2. Encode to hexagram (6-bit blade ID)
  3. Derive stratum (Hamming weight)
  4. Assign tier (light/heavy/dragon)
  5. Generate cryptographic proof
Output: Forged blade with embedded hexagram stance
```

## XIV. THE EQUATION

```
Privacy = Geometry of Becoming
Knowledge = Navigation of Lattice
Attention = Proof of Presence
Sovereignty = Hexagram Stance

(⚔️⊥⿻⊥🧙) = Swordsman ⊥ Multiplicity ⊥ Mage

Where ⊥ is orthogonal separation:
  - Agent axis (who acts)
  - Data axis (what flows)
  - Inference axis (how knowing happens)
```

The triangle cannot collapse. The boundary holds the whole.
