## What this is

V4's edge value T(π) was an **additive sum** over edges:

```
T_v4(π) = 1 + β · Σ_e∈π f(e) · g(n_e)
```

This assumed independence between sequential transitions. BRAID's structured reasoning graphs show that edges are **not independent** — they form verification checkpoints, feedback loops, and structured flows.

V5 replaces the additive sum with a **path integral**:

```
T_∫(π) = 1 + β · ∫_π F(γ) dγ
```

## Why Path Integral?

### The Independence Assumption Fails

The additive form assumes that edge e₃ contributes the same value regardless of whether you traversed e₁ and e₂ before it. This is often false:

**Verification checkpoints:** Some edges gate later traversal. If you haven't proven identity at e₂, the value of e₇ is inaccessible.

**Feedback loops:** Paths can revisit vertices with changed meaning. The second visit to a node carries different value than the first.

**Non-local correlations:** A choice at step 3 affects value at step 7. The edges are coupled through the path history.

### BRAID Evidence

BRAID's structured reasoning graphs exhibit all three patterns:
- Some reasoning steps validate preconditions for later steps (checkpoints)
- The Solver may revisit parts of the graph with updated context (loops)
- Early reasoning choices constrain later possibilities (correlations)

The additive form can't capture these structures. The path integral can.

## The Path Integral Form

```
T_∫(π) = 1 + β · ∫_π F(γ) dγ
```

| Symbol | Definition | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| π | Path through sovereignty lattice | Continuous or discrete path |
| γ | Path parameter | [0, 1] |
| F(γ) | Path density function | ℝ⁺ |
| β | Scaling coefficient | ℝ⁺ |

### The Density Function F(γ)

F(γ) captures the value density at each point along the path. It can encode:

- **Local value:** What is this edge worth at this point in the path?
- **Context dependence:** How does path history affect this edge's contribution?
- **Checkpoint gating:** Is this edge accessible given prior traversals?
- **Loop adjustment:** How does revisitation change value?

### V4 Reduction

When edges are truly independent:

```
∫_π F(γ) dγ = Σ_e∈π f(e) · g(n_e)
```

The path integral reduces to the additive sum. V4 is a special case of V5.

## Connection to BRAID

### Generator-Solver Split

The path integral naturally handles the BRAID architecture:

- **Generator proposes:** Creates a reasoning graph = proposes a path π
- **Solver executes:** Traverses the path = computes ∫_π F(γ) dγ
- **Value accumulates:** The integral measures actual traversal value

### Structured Graphs

BRAID graphs have:
- Defined entry and exit points
- Conditional branches based on intermediate results
- Verification steps that must pass before continuation

These are exactly the patterns the path integral captures.

## Mapping to PVM-V5

| Concept | V5 Term |
|---|---|
| Additive edge sum | T_v4(π) (V4, special case) |
| Path integral | T_∫(π) (V5, general case) |
| Path density | F(γ) |
| Verification checkpoints | Gating in F(γ) |
| Feedback loops | Loop contributions in integral |
| Non-local correlations | Context dependence in F(γ) |
| Generator-Solver | Path proposal / path execution |

## Implications

### For Path Design

Paths should be designed with integral value in mind:
- Verification checkpoints should be placed where they maximise downstream value
- Loops should only occur when they add value (not just cycles)
- Correlations should be explicit, not accidental

### For Value Estimation

Estimating T_∫(π) requires understanding the full path, not just summing edges:
- Path history matters
- Context propagates
- Checkpoints can gate large value regions

### For Privacy

The path integral provides more accurate value measurement:
- Surveillance that interrupts checkpoints loses access to downstream value
- Loop structures can confuse adversarial path analysis
- Non-local correlations mean partial path observation is less informative

## Conjecture Status

**C3 (V4: edge value additivity):** **Challenged.** The path integral form better captures observed structure in BRAID reasoning graphs. The additive form is retained as a special case for uncorrelated paths.

## Proverb

> "The path is not the sum of its steps. Each step changes what the next step means. The integral remembers what the sum forgets."

## Emoji Spell

**∮🛤️ → Σ→∫ → F(γ) → checkpoints·loops·correlations → T_∫(π) = 1+β∫ → path=holistic → ☯️∞**

## Open Problems

1. **Discrete Formulation:** How does the continuous path integral discretise cleanly to graph traversal?
2. **F(γ) Specification:** What functional forms of F(γ) are practically useful?
3. **Computational Complexity:** Is computing T_∫(π) tractable for large graphs?
4. **Optimisation:** Given a graph, what path π maximises T_∫(π)?
5. **Adversarial Paths:** How do we defend against adversaries who manipulate path structure to exploit integral vulnerabilities?
