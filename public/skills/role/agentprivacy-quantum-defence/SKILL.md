## What this is

The quantum threat is no longer theoretical. External validation (Google Quantum AI, March 2026) confirms: secp256k1 can be broken with ≤1,200 logical qubits. The 2D cryptographic fortress that protected value for thirty years is approaching its end.

**The lock that held for thirty years did not fail because the metal weakened. It failed because someone built an engine that sees in the dimension the lock forgot to guard.**

This skill addresses the quantum threat through dimensional defence — the 6D sovereignty lattice provides protection that 2D cryptography cannot.

## The Quantum Threat

### The 2D Fortress

Traditional cryptography relies on:
- Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)
- secp256k1 curve (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- 2D mathematical space

### The Vulnerability

Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer breaks ECDLP:

```
Classical: ECDLP requires O(2^(n/2)) operations
Quantum: ECDLP requires O(n³) operations
```

For secp256k1 (256-bit):
- Classical: ~2^128 operations (infeasible)
- Quantum: ~256³ ≈ 16 million operations (feasible with enough qubits)

### The Timeline

| Year | Logical Qubits | secp256k1 Status |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| 2024 | ~100 | Safe |
| 2025 | ~500 | Margin shrinking |
| 2026 | ~1,000 | Red zone approaching |
| 2027+ | ≥1,200 | **Breakable** |

**External validation:** Google Quantum AI paper (March 2026) confirms ≤1,200 logical qubits sufficient.

## The Three Storms

From Act XXIX, three storms approach simultaneously:

### Storm 1: Quantum Computing
- ECDLP broken
- secp256k1, secp256r1 vulnerable
- Timeline: 2-5 years

### Storm 2: AI Capability Explosion
- Pattern recognition at scale
- Behavioural prediction
- Metadata analysis

### Storm 3: Regulatory Convergence
- Global identity frameworks
- Financial surveillance
- Privacy erosion

The 2D fortress cannot withstand all three storms.

## The 6D Defence

### Dimensional Shift

The 6D sovereignty lattice provides defence through dimensionality:

```
2D cryptography: breaks when compute advances
6D sovereignty: survives dimensional shift

🔷⁶ᴰ ≠ 🔐²ᴰ
```

### Why 6D Helps

| Property | 2D Crypto | 6D Sovereignty |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Attack surface | Mathematical | Architectural |
| Failure mode | Total break | Graceful degradation |
| Upgrade path | Replace everything | Rotate dimensions |
| Time dependency | Fixed difficulty | Dynamic complexity |

### The Blade Configuration Defence

Each blade dimension provides orthogonal protection:
- d1 Hide: Data obscured (survives even with broken signatures)
- d2 Prove: ZK proofs (post-quantum variants exist)
- d3 Share: Selective disclosure (architectural, not cryptographic)
- d4 Revoke: Temporal limits (expiry regardless of crypto)
- d5 Recover: Social recovery (human trust, not math)
- d6 Delegate: Authority limits (governance, not computation)

Breaking one dimension does not break the others.

## Dormant Assets and Temporal Thesis

### The Dormant Asset Problem

Billions of dollars in cryptocurrency are controlled by:
- Lost keys
- Deceased owners
- Forgotten wallets

These assets are currently locked. Quantum computing unlocks them.

### The Temporal Thesis

From Act XXIX:

> "The 7th capital includes time-locked value. When the lock breaks, the capital flows to whoever holds the new keys."

Dormant assets represent a massive value transfer when quantum arrives:
- Estimate: 3-4 million BTC (15-20% of supply)
- Current value: ~$200B+ (at time of writing)
- Post-quantum: flows to quantum-capable actors

### Defence Strategy

1. **Active assets:** Migrate to post-quantum schemes
2. **Dormant assets:** Cannot be migrated (keys lost)
3. **Network-level:** Consider protocol changes (contentious)

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

### NIST Standards (2024)

| Algorithm | Type | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------|
| ML-KEM (Kyber) | Lattice-based | Key encapsulation |
| ML-DSA (Dilithium) | Lattice-based | Digital signatures |
| SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) | Hash-based | Signatures (conservative) |

### Integration Path

```
Current: secp256k1 → ML-DSA
ZK Proofs: Current SNARKs → Lattice-based SNARKs
VRCs: Add post-quantum signature layer
```

### Timeline for Migration

| Phase | Action | Urgency |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Now | Audit quantum exposure | High |
| 2025 | Develop migration path | High |
| 2026 | Begin migration | Critical |
| 2027 | Complete critical assets | Essential |

## Mapping to PVM-V5.2

| Quantum Defence Concept | PVM Term |
|-------------------------|----------|
| 2D vulnerability | Single-axis failure |
| 6D sovereignty | Multiplicative separation |
| Dormant assets | Temporal dynamics T(π) |
| Dimensional defence | Three-axis Φ |
| Post-quantum migration | Blade evolution |
| Graceful degradation | R_max < 1 preservation |

## Proverb

> "The lock that held for thirty years did not fail because the metal weakened. It failed because someone built an engine that sees in the dimension the lock forgot to guard."

## Entropy Proverb (Deepest Inscription)

> "Only time, the master swordsman, will tell — as it takes the seventh capital back from the emissary mage who named it another matter of their own."

## Open Problems

1. **Migration Coordination:** How to coordinate quantum migration across decentralised networks?
2. **Dormant Asset Governance:** What should happen to dormant assets post-quantum?
3. **ZK Quantum Resistance:** How to maintain ZK proof efficiency with post-quantum schemes?
4. **Timeline Uncertainty:** How to prepare when quantum timeline is uncertain?
5. **Hybrid Schemes:** How to balance current security with quantum preparation?
