## What this is

V4's network term treated all coordination as O(N²) — each agent potentially interacting with every other. BRAID's shared-parent pattern shows this is wrong for structured collaboration.

**Agents sharing a reasoning library from the same Generator don't need pairwise coordination.** They share a parent. The interaction cost drops from O(N²) to O(1) per guild member.

V5 adds:

```
Network_v5(G) = (1 + Σᵢ wᵢ · nᵢ/N₀)^k · G(guilds)

Where G(guilds) = 1 + guild_efficiency
```

## The Scaling Problem

### O(N²) Coordination

In a network of N agents where every pair might interact:
- Communication channels: N(N-1)/2
- Synchronisation overhead: O(N²)
- Coordination cost: Scales quadratically

This is why many networks collapse as they grow. The coordination overhead eventually exceeds the network benefit.

### O(1) Shared-Parent

Agents sharing a reasoning library (shared parent) coordinate differently:
- They inherit common context from the parent
- They don't need to synchronise pairwise
- New members add O(1) overhead, not O(N)

**The parent absorbs the coordination complexity.**

## Guild Structure

A guild is a set of agents sharing a reasoning parent:

```
Guild(G) = { agents a : parent(a) = G }
```

Properties:
- All agents in the guild share context from G
- New agent joining: O(1) to acquire parent context
- Agent-to-agent coordination within guild: O(1) (shared context)
- Cross-guild coordination: O(N) at guild level, not agent level

### Guild Efficiency

```
guild_efficiency = Σ_g (|guild_g|/N) · coordination_benefit(g)
```

Where:
- |guild_g| = number of agents in guild g
- N = total agents in network
- coordination_benefit(g) = efficiency gain from shared-parent in guild g

At full guild coverage with optimal structure:
- guild_efficiency → 1
- G(guilds) → 2 (doubles network effect)

## Connection to BRAID

BRAID's Generator-Solver split is exactly the shared-parent pattern:

- **Generator** = the parent (produces reasoning libraries)
- **Solver instances** = guild members (execute reasoning libraries)
- **Reasoning library** = shared context (skill file, cached graph)

Multiple Solver instances executing the same Generator's reasoning library form a natural guild. They coordinate at O(1) because they share the reasoning structure.

## Why This Matters for Scaling

### Graceful Networks

Networks that scale gracefully share a common pattern:
- Hierarchical parent structure
- Guild-based coordination
- O(1) per-member overhead

Examples:
- Academic disciplines (shared methodology = parent)
- Professional guilds (shared training = parent)
- BRAID deployments (shared Generator = parent)

### Collapsing Networks

Networks that collapse under coordination overhead:
- Flat, fully-connected structure
- No shared context inheritance
- O(N²) pairwise coordination

Examples:
- Unmoderated social networks
- All-hands meetings that scale with team size
- Consensus protocols requiring all-to-all communication

## Mapping to PVM-V5

| Concept | V5 Term |
|---|---|
| Network term | (1 + Σ wᵢ·nᵢ/N₀)^k |
| Guild efficiency factor | G(guilds) = 1 + guild_efficiency |
| Shared parent | Generator / reasoning library |
| Guild members | Solver instances / agents sharing parent |
| O(N²) → O(1) | Guild coordination benefit |
| Full network effect | Network_v5 = base^k · G(guilds) |

## Operational Guidance

### For Guild Design

- Identify natural parent structures (shared methodologies, tools, contexts)
- Design explicit parent inheritance (skill files, reasoning libraries)
- Measure guild_efficiency as coordination cost reduction
- Monitor for guild fragmentation (loss of shared context)

### For Network Scaling

- Structure networks into guilds, not flat meshes
- Cross-guild coordination should happen at guild level, not agent level
- Shared-parent patterns reduce coordination overhead exponentially
- Network health includes guild structure health

### For BRAID Deployment

- One Generator, many Solvers = one guild
- Multiple Generators = multiple guilds
- Inter-Generator coordination = cross-guild coordination
- Measure guild_efficiency as reasoning library reuse rate

## Conjecture C10

**C10:** O(1) shared-parent coordination modifies the effective network exponent k.

Status: Structurally implied by BRAID architecture; requires calibration against empirical guild performance data.

## Proverb

> "The ship with a captain sails. The fleet with a shared chart sails together. O(N²) is coordination. O(1) is culture."

## Emoji Spell

**🏛️ → O(N²)→O(1) → parent·child → shared_context → G(guilds) = 1+eff → Network↑ → 🌐🏛️∞**

## Open Problems

1. **C10 Calibration:** How do we measure the modification to effective k?
2. **Optimal Guild Size:** Is there an optimal guild size that maximises efficiency?
3. **Guild Fragmentation:** How do we detect and repair loss of shared context?
4. **Cross-Guild Protocols:** What coordination protocols work best between guilds?
5. **Nested Guilds:** Do hierarchical guild structures (guilds of guilds) provide further efficiency?
