## Economic thesis

Behavioural data is the 7th capital — after financial, manufactured, natural, social, human, and intellectual. It currently accrues almost entirely to platforms through extraction. PVM-V4 provides a pricing function that shows sovereign ownership of this capital generates 17×–12,000× more value than the extraction model. The model is not arguing privacy is morally preferable. It is arguing that privacy-preserving architectures are economically superior.

## The pricing function

V(π, t) = P^1.5 · C · Q · S · e^{-λt} · (1 + A(τ)) · (1 + Σ wᵢ nᵢ/N₀)^k · R(d) · M(u,y) · Φ(Σ) · T(π)

This is a multiplicative product across six valuation dimensions. The multiplicative structure is the core economic insight: privacy value is not additive. A system missing any single dimension produces zero value. You cannot compensate for weak cryptography with strong network effects, or for no credential verifiability with excellent data quality. Each dimension is a gate — pass all six or produce nothing.

## Key economic properties

**Superlinear returns on privacy investment.** P^1.5 means doubling privacy strength more than doubles value contribution. At P = 0.5, the contribution is ~0.35. At P = 1.0, it is 1.0. Half-measures destroy more than half the value. This creates an economic argument for maximal rather than "adequate" privacy investment.

**Verified history as compound interest.** The temporal term combines decay (e^{-λt}) with memory accumulation (1 + A(τ)). Individual data points depreciate, but a verified chain of sovereignty decisions appreciates logarithmically. This models what reputation economists observe: trust compounds, but only when it is verifiable. An agent with deep attested history can maintain or increase its total data value even as individual observations age.

**Power-law network effects with compositional weighting.** The network term (1 + Σ wᵢ nᵢ/N₀)^k is not a simple Metcalfe's law. Agents contribute differently based on their sovereignty configuration. The weighting follows binomial coefficients across 7 strata (1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 across 64 total configurations). Stratum 3 — the combinatorial midpoint — contributes maximum weight. Networks heavy in the middle generate more value than networks concentrated at extremes.

**Market maturity as demand-side readiness.** M(u,y) captures user sophistication and market year. Even a technically perfect system produces limited value if users cannot exercise sovereignty or if market infrastructure for privacy-preserving data exchange is absent. This term creates a formal basis for timing investment in privacy infrastructure.

## Tokenomics integration

The model maps to a dual-token economy:

**SWORD tokens** — earned through privacy-protecting behaviour (Swordsman function). Represent accumulated proof that an agent consistently enforces boundaries. Value correlates with the reconstruction resistance term R(d) and the temporal integrity h(τ).

**MAGE tokens** — earned through successful delegation and coordination (Mage function). Represent demonstrated ability to act on behalf of a principal without violating sovereignty. Value correlates with the edge value term T(π) and the network effect term.

**Armor progression** — token holdings unlock capability tiers: Blade → Light → Heavy → Dragon. This is not a pay-to-play model; it is a demonstrate-to-earn model. Agents cannot purchase higher tiers. They must exhibit sustained privacy-respecting behaviour across enough sovereignty transitions. The logarithmic memory term A(τ) naturally models this: early transitions provide the most marginal value, creating strong incentives for early good behaviour.

**Token interaction.** The separation matrix Σ requires that SWORD and MAGE token economies remain independent. Cross-contamination (e.g., earning SWORD tokens through delegation activity) would violate the conditional independence that guarantees the reconstruction ceiling R < 1.

## Surveillance gap as market inefficiency

Under PVM-V4, surveillance architectures access only a fraction of the value manifold available to sovereign architectures. This gap (17×–12,000× depending on parameterisation) is not a moral judgment — it is a market inefficiency. Platforms extracting behavioural data are leaving 94–99.99% of that data's potential value on the table because their architecture is topologically constrained from accessing it.

The gap is topological, not arithmetic. Surveillance systems cannot incrementally become sovereign. Activating privacy protection breaks the extraction pipelines that generate their current revenue. The transition requires architectural redesign, which creates a window for new entrants building privacy-first infrastructure.

## DeFi and data market applications

**Privacy-preserving data markets.** The model provides a pricing oracle for privacy-preserving data exchanges. Each data asset carries a computable V(π, t) based on its measurable properties. This enables automated market-making for data where price reflects sovereignty quality rather than volume or novelty alone.

**Liquidity for verified history.** The temporal memory term A(τ) suggests that verified agent histories are tradeable assets. An agent with deep, attested history has quantifiably more value than a fresh agent. This creates a secondary market for agent reputation — not selling the data itself, but selling verifiable proof of the quality and depth of sovereignty decisions made on that data.

**Sovereignty-weighted yield.** DeFi protocols can use stratum weighting to determine yield allocation. Participants at higher sovereignty strata (more dimensions active) receive proportionally more yield, creating economic incentives for sovereignty improvement rather than just liquidity provision.

**The determinant as collateral quality.** The sovereignty duality term Φ(Σ) = min(1.0, (S/M)/φ) · det(Σ) provides a single scalar measure of architectural quality. det(Σ) close to 1 means well-separated forces; close to 0 means entangled and vulnerable. This scalar could serve as a collateral quality rating for data-backed financial instruments.

## Inference economics: Performance-Per-Dollar

BRAID (Amcalar & Cinar, arXiv:2512.15959) introduces PPD (Performance-Per-Dollar) as the inference-layer economic metric:

PPD = (Accuracy/Cost) / (Accuracy_baseline/Cost_baseline)

This is V(π,t) for inference. Both are multiplicative value functions normalised against a baseline. Both reveal that the optimal configuration is structured separation, not monolithic scale.

**The Golden Quadrant maps to dual-agent economics:**
- Expensive generator + cheap solver → maximum PPD (30–74×)
- This mirrors: expensive privacy infrastructure + cheap marginal operations → maximum V(π,t)

**Amortisation model:** C_amortized = C_BRAID/N + C_inference. As N→∞, generation cost → 0. Privacy infrastructure follows the same curve: high upfront separation cost amortised toward zero per operation.

**Guild reasoning economics:** A guild that generates and validates BRAID graphs creates a capital good (reasoning infrastructure). Members who use the cached graphs benefit from amortised costs. Graph quality = guild reputation. This extends the SWORD/MAGE token model: generating a validated graph = earning MAGE tokens (delegation value created).

## Measurement and calibration needs

The model has four empirically uncalibrated terms: the memory scaling coefficient α, the edge value coefficient β, the temporal decay rate λ, and the edge weight function f(e). These require calibration against real agent economic data — transaction volumes, privacy breach costs, reputation premiums, and data market prices. The model is structurally complete but quantitatively ungrounded until these are measured.

## Open questions for economists

1. Does the 17×–12,000× gap hold under empirical calibration, or does it narrow/widen?
2. Is the golden ratio φ genuinely optimal for protect/project balance, or is this an artefact of the model structure?
3. What discount rate should apply to A(τ) for agents with verified histories spanning multiple market cycles?
4. How do sovereignty transitions interact with traditional financial risk models?
5. Can the multiplicative gating property be exploited by adversaries to cheaply collapse entire markets by targeting a single dimension?
