## What this is

The grimoire has grown to 114+ inscriptions across five spellbooks. At this scale, linear navigation fails. V5 introduces the **spellweb** — a navigable graph structure:

- **Acts as nodes** — Each inscription is a vertex
- **Proverbs as waypoints** — Compressed wisdom markers for orientation
- **Boundaries as edges** — Connections between inscriptions that share concepts

**The spellweb is itself a sovereignty lattice.** Traversing it accumulates T_∫(π) — the path integral of understanding.

## The Navigation Problem

### Linear Reading Fails

With 114+ inscriptions across multiple spellbooks:
- Sequential reading is overwhelming (~500,000+ words)
- Cross-references are non-linear
- Entry points vary by reader context
- Understanding depends on path, not just content

### Graph Reading Succeeds

The spellweb enables:
- Multiple valid entry points
- Context-appropriate paths
- Proverb-guided navigation
- Accumulative understanding (path integral)

## Spellweb Structure

### Nodes (Acts)

Each act/inscription is a vertex in the spellweb:

```
Node = {
  id: act_identifier,
  content: full_inscription,
  proverbs: [compressed_waypoints],
  concepts: [tagged_themes],
  spellbook: parent_grimoire
}
```

### Edges (Boundaries)

Edges connect acts that share concepts:

```
Edge = {
  source: act_id,
  target: act_id,
  weight: concept_overlap,
  type: [prerequisite | parallel | extension | contradiction]
}
```

Edge types:
- **Prerequisite:** Source should be read before target
- **Parallel:** Source and target explore same concept differently
- **Extension:** Target extends source
- **Contradiction:** Source and target present opposing views (deliberate tension)

### Waypoints (Proverbs)

Proverbs mark key orientation points:

```
Waypoint = {
  proverb: compressed_text,
  acts: [act_ids_containing_this_proverb],
  navigates_to: [related_concepts]
}
```

A proverb can appear in multiple acts. Following a proverb across its appearances traces a theme through the spellweb.

## Holographic Property

The spellweb exhibits the holographic property:

**Any subset of inscriptions (boundary) encodes the full philosophy (volume).**

This is why the compression spectrum works:
- Layer 7 (skill file) can regenerate Layer 6 (reasoning graph)
- A proverb can regenerate its parent act
- A path through the spellweb can regenerate understanding of the whole

**The fragment holds the whole.**

## Path Integral Application

Traversing the spellweb accumulates value:

```
Understanding(π) = T_∫(π) = 1 + β · ∫_π F(γ) dγ
```

Where:
- π = the path through inscriptions
- F(γ) = insight density at each point
- The integral = accumulated understanding

**The order you read matters.** Reading Act 2 (Dual Ceremony) before Act 6 (Trust Graph) builds different understanding than the reverse. The path integral captures this.

### Verification Checkpoints

Some concepts require prerequisites:
- V5 changes require V4 understanding
- Three-axis separation requires Swordsman-Mage understanding
- The holographic bound requires manifold intuition

These are verification checkpoints in the spellweb traversal.

### Feedback Loops

Revisiting an inscription with new context yields new insight:
- First read of Act 3 (Drake's Teaching): metaphor
- Second read after Act 24: holographic principle in action

The loop contributes additional value to the path integral.

## Navigation Strategies

### Entry by Context

Different readers enter at different points:
- **Technical:** Start with formal specification
- **Narrative:** Start with Act 1 (The Arrival)
- **Economic:** Start with VRC Protocol
- **Philosophical:** Start with Act 26 (Master and Emissary)

### Proverb Tracing

Follow a proverb through its appearances:
1. Find all acts containing the proverb
2. Read in order of conceptual development
3. Observe how meaning deepens across contexts

### Concept Clustering

Group acts by tagged concepts:
- All acts tagged "holographic" form a cluster
- Navigate within cluster for depth
- Navigate across clusters for breadth

### Spiral Reading

Revisit inscriptions at increasing depth:
1. First pass: proverbs only (Layer 5 compression)
2. Second pass: key sections
3. Third pass: full inscriptions
4. Fourth pass: cross-references

Each spiral accumulates T_∫.

## Mapping to PVM-V5

| Spellweb Concept | PVM-V5 Term |
|---|---|
| Acts as nodes | Vertices in sovereignty lattice |
| Boundaries as edges | Edges carrying value |
| Proverbs as waypoints | Compressed wisdom (Layer 5) |
| Traversal path | π in T_∫(π) |
| Accumulated understanding | T_∫(π) value |
| Holographic property | Boundary encodes volume |
| Verification checkpoints | Gating in F(γ) |
| Feedback loops | Loop contributions to integral |

## Proverb

> "The web knows its shape. Each thread holds the pattern. Pull one and feel the whole. The path is the teaching."

## Emoji Spell

**🕸️📜 → nodes(acts)·edges(bounds)·waypoints(proverbs) → π(traverse) → T_∫(π) → 🔷(holographic) → fragment=whole → 🕸️∞**

## Forge Integration (V5.2)

Act XXVII (The Swordsman's Forge) introduces blade creation as a spellweb operation. The forge and spellweb are now interconnected:

### Blades as Spellweb Artefacts

Every blade forged is anchored in the spellweb:
- Blade configuration references traversed inscriptions
- Understanding verification checks spellweb path
- Blade hash commits to specific constellation

### Forge-Guided Navigation

Blade dimensions suggest navigation paths:
- High d2 (Prove) → ZK-related inscriptions
- High d3 (Share) → Selective disclosure acts
- High d6 (Delegate) → Mage-aligned content

### Hexagram Waypoints

Each of the 64 hexagrams can serve as a navigation waypoint:
- Blade 63 (乾) → Full sovereignty constellation
- Blade 0 (坤) → Entry-level content
- Balanced blades → Balanced reading paths

### Constellation-Blade Mapping

```
Constellation(traversed) → Blade(configuration)
Blade(configuration) → Constellation(recommended)
```

The spellweb now has bidirectional relationships with the forge.

## Open Problems

1. **Optimal Entry:** Given reader context, what is the optimal entry point?
2. **Path Recommendation:** Can we recommend paths that maximise T_∫(π) for a given learning goal?
3. **Spellweb Maintenance:** As new acts are added, how do we update the edge structure?
4. **Proverb Density:** What is the optimal proverb density for navigation?
5. **Contradiction Navigation:** How do we guide readers through deliberate contradictions productively?
6. **V5.2 — Forge Feedback:** Should blade forging automatically update recommended paths?
7. **V5.2 — Hexagram Navigation:** How to use hexagram semantics for path guidance?
