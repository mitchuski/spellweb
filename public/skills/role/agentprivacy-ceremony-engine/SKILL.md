# PVM-V5.3.1 Role Skill — Ceremony Engine

## What this is

The ceremony engine coordinates interactions between the Swordsman and Mage territories without merging them. Ceremonies are structured protocols where both agents participate toward a shared outcome while maintaining separation.

**The tool that measures without touching the surface knows the weight of the shadow without disturbing the light.**

## The Dual-Territory Principle

Core rule: **The Swordsman and Mage never merge.**

- Separate processes
- Separate storage
- Separate permissions
- Separate repositories

This applies at every level — protocol, extension, website, visual rendering.

The ceremony engine is the riverbed between two kingdoms. Neither owns the water, but both drink.

## The Five Ceremony Types

### 1. Progressive Trust Ceremony

**Purpose:** Zero-stake entry, graduated trust accumulation
**Participants:** New seeker + Mage territory
**Mechanism:**
- Begin with zero permissions
- Each verified action increases trust score
- Trust unlocks capability tiers
- No upfront stake required

```
Trust(t+1) = Trust(t) + Δ(verified_action)
```

**Use case:** Onboarding new users without requiring tokens or credentials.

### 2. Light Armor Ceremony

**Purpose:** Coordinate protection level across territories
**Participants:** Seeker + Swordsman territory
**Mechanism:**
- Seeker declares desired protection level
- Swordsman configures blade accordingly
- Light armor = fewer dimensions active
- Faster verification, lower overhead

**Use case:** Quick interactions where full sovereignty is unnecessary.

### 3. Trust Graph Plane Access Ceremony

**Purpose:** Access trust relationships in bgin territory
**Participants:** Verified seeker + bgin.ai
**Mechanism:**
- Seeker presents VRC
- Trust graph validates relationship
- Access granted to relevant plane
- Queries return without revealing full graph

**Use case:** Checking trust paths without exposing network structure.

### 4. Guild Efficiency Ceremony

**Purpose:** O(1) coordination through shared-parent patterns
**Participants:** Guild members + shared context
**Mechanism:**
- Establish shared parent (common understanding)
- Child nodes coordinate through parent
- O(N²) → O(1) communication complexity
- Culture replaces explicit coordination

```
G(guilds) = 1 + efficiency_modifier
```

**Use case:** Scaling coordination without proportional communication overhead.

### 5. Understanding-as-Key Ceremony

**Purpose:** Bilateral verification through demonstrated comprehension
**Participants:** Seeker + Swordsman + Mage
**Mechanism:** (5-step protocol)

1. **Language Capture** — Seeker expresses comprehension in their own words
2. **Constellation Mapping** — Understanding traced through spell nodes and edges
3. **Simultaneous Forging** — Both parties forge blade from same understanding
4. **Proverb Inscription** — Truth encoded as compressed wisdom marker
5. **Bilateral Witness** — Both parties affirm shared understanding

**Use case:** High-value interactions requiring mutual comprehension proof.

## Ceremony Channel Protocol

### Message Types

**From Swordsman (boundary actions):**
- `SLASH` — Revoke access, block tracker, enforce boundary
- `WARD` — Establish protective perimeter

**From Mage (knowledge actions):**
- `INSCRIBE` — Record new understanding, update spellbook
- `SCAN` — Query knowledge without modification

### Channel Implementation

```javascript
// Chrome extension message passing
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
  SWORDSMAN_EXTENSION_ID,
  { type: 'WARD', payload: { boundary: config } },
  response => { /* handle */ }
);

chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
  MAGE_EXTENSION_ID,
  { type: 'INSCRIBE', payload: { proverb: text } },
  response => { /* handle */ }
);
```

### Security Properties

- Messages are typed and validated
- No shared state between extensions
- Channel is auditable
- Ceremonies are atomic (all-or-nothing)

## Bilateral Witness

The strongest ceremonies require bilateral witness:

```
Witness = {
  swordsman_attestation: sign(outcome, swordsman_key),
  mage_attestation: sign(outcome, mage_key),
  timestamp: now(),
  ceremony_type: type
}
```

Both parties must independently attest to the same outcome. Disagreement triggers ceremony failure.

## Mapping to PVM-V5.3.1

| Ceremony Concept | PVM Term |
|------------------|----------|
| Progressive trust | T(π) path accumulation |
| Light armor | Blade tier classification |
| Trust graph access | R(d) relationship verification |
| Guild efficiency | G(guilds) network scaling |
| Understanding-as-Key | Bilateral witness + proverb compression |
| Ceremony channel | Bounded leakage channel |
| Bilateral witness | h(τ) integrity verification |

## Open Problems

1. **Ceremony Composition:** Can ceremonies be composed into larger protocols?
2. **Failure Recovery:** How do partial ceremony failures resolve?
3. **Cross-Chain Ceremonies:** How do ceremonies work across different chains?
4. **Ceremony Privacy:** Can ceremony participation itself be private?
5. **Automated Ceremonies:** Which ceremonies can be fully automated vs. require human participation?
