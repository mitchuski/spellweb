## What this is

The sovereignty lattice has toroidal topology—edges that exit one face re-enter the opposite face. This creates cyclic paths through the lattice. Unlike a flat space where paths between points are finite, the torus allows infinite distinct paths. This property is the source of zero-knowledge soundness.

**The torus wraps. The paths multiply. The witness space becomes infinite. And infinite witnesses cannot be enumerated.**

## Flat vs Toroidal

### Flat Lattice

On a flat 6-dimensional hypercube:
- Paths between vertices are finite
- Can enumerate all paths of length ≤ k
- Given enough time, can find any specific path
- Witness extraction is theoretically possible

### Toroidal Lattice

On a toroidal 6-dimensional structure:
- Paths between vertices are infinite
- Every path has infinitely many variants (add cycles)
- Cannot enumerate all paths
- Witness extraction is computationally infeasible

## The Wrapping Property

### Edge Wrapping

When traversing dimension d beyond the boundary:

```
vertex[d] = (vertex[d] + delta) mod 2
```

But at the lattice level, the wrap creates NEW paths, not just the same path repeated:

```
Path A: 0 → 1 → 3 → 7 (direct)
Path B: 0 → 1 → 3 → 7 → [wrap] → 0 → 1 → 3 → 7 (one cycle added)
Path C: 0 → 1 → 3 → 7 → [wrap] → 0 → ... (n cycles added)
```

Each is a distinct path producing the same endpoint.

### Topological Cycles

The torus has two fundamental cycles (in 2D analogy):
- Around the "hole" (poloidal)
- Around the "tube" (toroidal)

In 6D, there are more independent cycles. Each cycle can be traversed any number of times, creating combinatorial explosion in path count.

## Why This Creates ZK Property

### The ZK Setup

- **Statement:** "I know a path from vertex A to vertex B"
- **Witness:** The specific path taken
- **Verification:** Check that following the path reaches B

### Without Torus (Insecure)

Adversary strategy:
1. Enumerate all paths from A to B
2. There are finitely many
3. Eventually find the prover's path
4. Witness extracted

### With Torus (Secure)

Adversary strategy fails:
1. Try to enumerate all paths from A to B
2. For each path, infinite cyclic variants exist
3. Cannot complete enumeration
4. Cannot isolate the prover's specific path
5. Witness remains hidden

## Formal Statement

**Claim:** On a toroidal lattice, given a valid proof that path P exists from A to B, extracting P is computationally infeasible.

**Intuition:**
- The proof verifies ∃P: P(A) = B
- The torus guarantees |{P: P(A) = B}| = ∞
- The verifier cannot distinguish which P was used
- Even with the proof, the witness space is unbounded

**Confidence:** ~70% — The topological argument is sound, but formal reduction to standard hardness assumptions needs work.

## Path Multiplicity Example

Consider reaching vertex 7 (binary: 000111) from vertex 0 (binary: 000000):

**Minimal paths (length 3):**
```
0 → 1 → 3 → 7
0 → 2 → 3 → 7
0 → 4 → 5 → 7
... (C(3,3) × permutations = multiple)
```

**With one toroidal cycle:**
```
0 → 1 → 3 → 7 → 6 → 4 → 0 → 1 → 3 → 7
```

**With n cycles:** Each adds 6+ steps, creating infinite family.

**With different cycle choices:** Multiple independent cycles exist.

The witness space is not just large—it is infinite.

## Implications for Ceremony Design

### Witness Hiding

Ceremonies should leverage toroidal structure:
- Record that path was completed
- Do NOT record which specific path
- Verifier confirms destination reached
- Path remains private

### Path Equivalence Classes

For some purposes, cyclic variants are equivalent:
- Same start and end
- Same inscriptions traversed (modulo cycles)
- Different "winding numbers"

The ceremony can verify equivalence class membership without identifying specific path.

### Proof Size

Despite infinite witnesses, proofs remain finite:
- Prove you COULD take a path (existential)
- Don't enumerate the path (avoid linear size)
- ZK-SNARK techniques apply

## Mapping to PVM-V5

| Toroidal Concept | PVM Term |
|------------------|----------|
| Path multiplicity | T_∫(π) unbounded |
| Cyclic structure | Lattice invariants |
| Witness hiding | Gap preservation |
| Enumeration infeasibility | Computational hardness |
| Topological cycles | Holographic boundary wrap |

## Connection to Holographic Bound

The 96-edge boundary wraps the 64-vertex bulk:
- Boundary IS where cycles live
- Holographic encoding includes cycle structure
- 96/64 = 1.5 reflects the boundary "excess" needed for wrap

The torus is not separate from the holographic principle—it IS the holographic principle in topological form.

## Proverb

> "The flat space counts its paths and finds them finite. The torus counts its paths and loses count. In that losing, sovereignty lives—for what cannot be enumerated cannot be captured."

## Emoji Spell

**🍩 → wrap(∂) → paths(∞) → |W|=∞ · enumerate(fail) · ZK(sound) · 🔷🔷🔷...🔷**

## Open Problems

1. **Formal Reduction:** Can we reduce toroidal witness hiding to standard assumptions (DLP, LWE)?
2. **Cycle Counting:** How many independent cycles exist in the 6D toroidal lattice?
3. **Practical Security:** What are the concrete bit-security estimates?
4. **Proof Systems:** Which ZK proof systems best leverage toroidal structure?
5. **Topology Variants:** Would other topologies (Klein bottle, projective space) have different security properties?
